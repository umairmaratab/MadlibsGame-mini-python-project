# MadlibsGame-mini-python-project
Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game created by Leonard Stern and Roger Price. 
It consists of one player prompting others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud. 

# Words can be:
* Adjectives
* Verbs
* Nouns etc

# Example:
Computer programming is so {adj}! It makes me so excited all the time because \
I love to {verb1}. Stay tuned and {verb2} Like you are {famous_person}!

## Here we have to place adjectives, verb1,verb2 and noun at the end.

# Running this project
